                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: To explore how demographic, cabin choice, and on-ground or in-flight services influence satisfaction, retention, and potential revenue drivers across the airline’s customer base.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/cpds 870.png">
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: To improve the performance and reverse the recent decline in engagement, focus more on video content especially those that share real stories or clearly explain product value. Refreshing the content style for the rest of the year is important, as engagement started to decline in May. It's also helpful to test successful formats, such as short videos or infographics, on platforms that have lower performance like Facebook and LinkedIn. High-performing hashtags should be used more consistently, while new ones can be tested to align with current trends. Revisiting the posting schedule and repeating the strategies that worked well in the early part of the year can help bring engagement back up.</p>

                <a href="../web-portfolio/airline-passenger-satisfaction.html">Airline Passenger Satisfaction Report</a>
                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: To explore how demographic, cabin choice, and on-ground or in-flight services influence satisfaction, retention, and potential revenue drivers across the airline’s customer base.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/1 - apsr.png">
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Airlines do well with personal service and cabin comfort, but fall short when it comes to digital tools and keeping schedules on track. Making it easier to book and improving in-flight Wi-Fi could quickly raise satisfaction above the current average of 3.2, especially important for the many loyal, repeat travelers who make up most of the passengers.</p>

                <a href="../web-portfolio/mobile-sales-report-2024.html">Mobile Sales Report</a>
                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Show which regions, models, and brands lead, how storage, color, and payment choices vary, and how seasonality, pricing, and sentiment impact sales and growth.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/msr2024/1 - msr2024.png">
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: To drive growth, keep Luzon well-stocked with strong promos and apply BARMM’s local strategies in other areas. Boost February with early-year bundles and repeat October’s successful campaigns. Focus on 256 GB iPhone 15 bundles, but keep Google and Xiaomi visible to attract new buyers. Offer all colors, with extra stock of black and green. Continue supporting all payment methods and add small perks to encourage e-cash and card use for a smoother checkout experience.</p>

                <a href="../web-portfolio/it-jobs-analysis.html">IT Jobs Data Analysis</a>
                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Turn survey data from 4,001 IT pros into a clear dashboard showing location, salary, language preferences, demographics, and experience by role and region.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/1 - ijda.png">
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Most respondents are mid-level pros aged 25-34, and nearly half of all IT roles sit in just four regions (Region IV tops the list). Cloud and database specialists earn more than twice what IT support staff make, which could push lower-paid talent to leave. Finally, there are very few entry-level hires, and executives appear in the data highlights diversity and leadership-pipeline gaps.</p>
