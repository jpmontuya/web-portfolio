                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: To turn survey results from 4,001 IT professionals into one clear dashboard that shows who works where, how much they earn, which languages they prefer, their age and gender mix, and how experience levels differ by region and role.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Viz</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/jpmontuya/it-jobs-data-analysis-dashboard/blob/12122499b584bf06fa2fd96d4b3b2c4bb5841de6/IT%20Jobs%20Data%20Analysis%20Dashboard.pbix" title="Power BI dashboard file" target="_blank">Power BI raw file</a></p>
                <p><strong>Data Limitations</strong>: The absolute numbers may be influenced by the survey's respondent pool composition, and don't necessarily reflect industry-wide proportions.</p> 
                <h4>Analysis Breakdown</h4>
                <p>There are a total number of IT survey takers: <strong>4,001</strong> with an average of 35.68.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/2 - ijda.png">
                <p>Most of the IT professionals surveyed are early in their careers. Junior roles are very common (1,333 people), making up about 61% of mid-level, while entry-levels are rare (only 22 people). This suggests the industry hires more people with some experience rather than those just starting out. Senior roles (657 people) are four times more common than top Executive roles (165), which could mean it’s harder to reach the highest positions either due to fewer opportunities or people leaving at that level.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/3 - ijda.png">
                <p>The highest-paying roles are in Information Security (93,532) and Cloud Engineering (81,491) commanding the highest average salaries, reflecting strong demand for cybersecurity and cloud expertise. On the lower end, Computer Support (28,802) and Web Design (35,135) earn much less.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/4 - ijda.png">
                <p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language, likely due to its wide use in web and full-stack development. Java and Python come next, with Java being common in big business systems and Python popular for data science and AI. PHP is much less popular.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/5 - ijda.png">
                <p>Most ITs are young, over half (55.6%) are between 25-34 years old. About a quarter (25.7%) are 35-44, while older professionals (45-64) make up just under 15%, which might mean fewer people stay in IT later in their careers or switch to IT at older ages. The youngest group (18-24) is the smallest at just 4.17%.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/6 - ijda.png">
                <p>The IT industry has a big gender gap. Men make up most of the workforce (60%, or 2,394 people), while women account for just 27% (1,095). Nonbinary professionals represent 13% (512), showing some progress toward diversity in gender identity.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/7 - ijda.png">
                <p>JavaScript is the most used language across nearly all job titles, peaking in Web Development, Software Development, and Computer Support. This confirms its status as the universal language for both front-end and full-stack development. Java shows strong adoption in Software Development and Computer Support, Python has broad appeal but peaks in IT Analysis and Computer Support, SQL is most prevalent in Software Development and Network Engineering.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/ijda/8 - ijda.png">
                <p>Region IV accounts for almost 13% of all recorded positions with a roughly 3.6 × Region IX’s total. This suggests either a larger workforce, more complete data capture, or stronger hiring programs in the certain region. The five highest-count regions (IV, III, VI, BARMM, V) hold ≈ 44 % of the national total.</p>
                <h4>Key Insights</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over half of respondents are aged 25-34, and nearly 60 % sit at mid-level seniority.</li>
                        <li>Four regions (IV, III, VI, BARMM) house roughly 44 % of surveyed IT roles.</li>
                        <li>Cloud and software engineering command the highest average salaries, confirming industry-wide competition for these skills.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript and Python dominate preference lists, investing around these languages will likely accelerate project velocity.</li>
                        <li>Gender segmentation highlights the need to broaden outreach if parity targets exist, especially in senior and executive levels.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Most respondents are mid-level pros aged 25-34, and nearly half of all IT roles sit in just four regions (Region IV tops the list). Cloud and database specialists earn more than twice what IT support staff make, which could push lower-paid talent to leave. Finally, there are very few entry-level hires, and executives appear in the data highlights diversity and leadership-pipeline gaps.</p>
