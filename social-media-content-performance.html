                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: To determine what factors contribute the most to social media content performance and audience engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of social media posts across multiple platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and X.com. The dataset included post-level details such as content type, category, platform, region, hashtags, and engagement metrics like likes, shares, comments, views, impressions, and engagement rate. The project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), comparing performance by platform, post type, and content category, and identifying trends over time. Key engagement drivers such as hashtags, post timing, and region-based performance were also examined to uncover what makes content successful.</p>

                <h4>Analysis Breakdown</h4>
                    <div class="smcp-row-1">
                        <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/4a - smcp kpi.png">
                        <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/4b - smcp kpi.png">

                    </div>
                <p>Data shows a total of 5.8B impressions highlights strong content distribution across platforms with a total likes of 844M and an average engagement of 115K.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/5a - smcp.png">
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/5b - smcp.png">
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/5c - smcp.png">
                <p>This shows how content engagement changed month by month, comparing each month’s performance to the one <em>before</em> it. In early 2024, there were some ups and downs, February dropped after January, but things picked up again by June, which had one of the <em>highest engagement levels</em>. From mid-2024 through early 2025, engagement stayed consistently strong, which means that content efforts were working well overall.</p>
                <p>However, something noticeable happened in May and June 2025, the engagement levels dropped sharply. This could mean there were fewer posts or changes in the type of content. It’s a signal worth checking out to understand what might have shifted recently.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/6 - smcp.png">
                <p>The <strong>USA</strong> has the highest number of posts at <strong>752</strong>, followed closely by Canada (735) and the UK (732). At the lower end, Germany had the fewest posts, with 627. Overall, this shows <strong>fairly balanced activity</strong> across all regions, with a difference of just over 100 posts between the highest and lowest. This suggests a strong global effort in content distribution, though some regions like Germany and Australia may present opportunities to increase publishing frequency.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/7 - smcp.png">
                <p><strong>Video</strong> posts lead by a large margin, generating over 73% of total engagements (350M+). In comparison, the next most engaging format is images which accounts for only about 9% (42.4M). Other post types like live streams, text, articles, carousels, and PDFs trail behind, each contributing less than 8%. This clearly shows that videos are by far the <strong>most effective format</strong> for capturing attention and interaction across social media.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/8 - smcp.png">
                <p><strong>Educational content</strong> came out on top with the highest percentage <strong>(36.3%)</strong>, closely followed by <strong>Product Promotion (35.6%)</strong>. Together, they make up over 70% of total engagement which highlights the strong interest in informative and product-focused posts.</p>
                <p>Entertainment content also contributed a decent portion (12.7%), while Customer Stories (10.7%) and Events/Webinars (4.8%) had smaller. This suggests that <em>content that teaches</em> or <em>showcases products</em> tends to <strong>connect most</strong> with the audience.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/9 - smcp.png">
                <p><strong>Video</strong> stands out significantly, reaching over <strong>4.8 billion engagements</strong> and <strong>4.3 billion impressions</strong>, far beyond any other format. It's the clear <strong>front-runner</strong> in both <em>visibility</em> and <em>audience interaction</em>. Other formats like images and live streams follow distantly, each bringing in around 470 to 490 million engagements. Text posts, articles, carousels, and PDFs had much smaller impact in both reach and interaction. The data conveys that videos not only get seen more, they also <em>get people to engage more</em> than any other type of content.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/10 - smcp.png">
                <p>Data reveals how different platforms compare in terms of likes, shares, and overall engagement rate. <strong>YouTube</strong> ranks <strong>highest</strong> among the platforms, with the most likes (196M+), shares (61M+), and the top engagement rate. TikTok, X.com, and Instagram also show strong performance, each contributing significant engagements, especially in likes and shares.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, LinkedIn and Facebook trail behind. While LinkedIn has a decent number of shares (19M), it lags in likes and overall engagement. Facebook shows the lowest engagement rate and interaction volume, despite having 15M shares.</p>
                <p>This indicates that <strong>video-centric platforms</strong> like <strong>YouTube</strong> and <strong>TikTok</strong> continue to dominate audience interaction, while platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook may require different content strategies to boost performance.</p>

                    </div>
                <p><strong>#SuccessStory</strong> was the hashtag most frequently used, there is a total of <strong>5,600 posts</strong> generating over <strong>844 million likes</strong>, <strong>267 million shares</strong>, and reaching <strong>5 billion views</strong>.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/12 - smcp.png">
                <p>Based on engagement rate <strong>YouTube</strong> and <strong>TikTok</strong> stands out, especially for <strong>educational content</strong>, with engagement rates of <strong>98.25</strong> and <strong>94.86</strong> respectively. Meanwhile, Facebook consistently shows the lowest engagement across all categories, suggesting it may not be the best platform for driving interaction. Instagram performs well for educational, product promotion, and customer stories, while LinkedIn is strongest with entertainment and customer stories but falls short in most other areas.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/13 - smcp.png">
                <p><strong>#ProductDemo</strong> drove the <strong>most clicks</strong> across content with over <strong>9.1 million clicks</strong>, followed by #CustomerStory (5.4M) and #TrendingNow (4.6M). These tags likely resonated well due to their clarity and relevance to what users are actively seeking.</p>
                <p>Other hashtags like #SuccessStory, #SaaSLaunch, and #DidYouKnow also show strong performance in the 2M–3.5M range. Toward the bottom, tags such as #BehindTheScenes and #CaseStudy2025 had very low click-through, this could mean they might not be as engaging or visible to the audience.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/14 - smcp.png">
                <p>This reveals how engagement levels are spread across different regions. <strong>Canada</strong> leads slightly with <strong>129 engagement-level counts</strong>, followed closely by the USA (128) and the UK (123). These three regions together account for over 39% of total engagement-level activity.</p>
                <p>The other regions follow closely behind, with Germany showing the lowest count at 108. Overall, it means a fairly even global distribution of engagement, with no single region dominating by a large margin. This suggests that content is performing consistently well across regions, though Canada and the U.S. might be slightly ahead in audience interaction.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/15 - smcp.png">
                <p>The data shows a <strong>strong start</strong> to the year, with April (132), March (125), and January (116) recording the highest overall engagement levels. During these months, regions like Japan, UK, and USA contributed significantly to the total.</p>
                <p>In contrast, activity drops sharply after April with May through December averaging much lower, between 51 and 69 engagement counts. This decline suggests a seasonal trend, possibly tied to posts cycles or a shift in content volume mid-year.</p>
                <p>Despite the dip, this also reveals that there is a balanced participation across regions throughout the year which indicates a steady global content push even during quieter months.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/smcp/16 - smcp.png">
                <p>This table showcases the top-performing posts based on raw engagement metrics such as likes, comments, clicks, shares, views, and engagement rate.</p>
                <p><strong>Post_590</strong> stands out with the <em>highest like count</em> (1.9M) and a <em>strong engagement rate</em> of 0.22, indicating that the post was effective. Post_139 also achieved the same engagement rate (0.22) despite having fewer views than Post_590, this suggests that it was efficient in driving user engagement per view. Meanwhile, some posts like Post_1415 and Post_4129 had high view and interaction volumes, but relatively low engagement rates (0.08 and 0.06 respectively), which may point to content that was widely seen but less compelling. It is easier to distinguish which formats or themes can be applied to future posts that generate not just reach, but quality engagement.</p>
                <h4>Key Insights</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Video content is the most powerful driver of engagement. Videos accounted for over 70% of total interactions and led in both impressions and likes across all platforms.</li>
                        <li>Educational and product promotional content emerged as the top-performing categories, contributing the highest total engagement.</li>
                        <li>Among platforms, YouTube, TikTok, and X.com consistently outperformed others, not only in raw numbers but also in engagement rates, particularly when paired with relevant hashtags like #CustomerStory, #SuccessStory, and #ProductDemo.</li>
                        <li>The first quarter of the year, especially March and April delivered the highest engagement activity with noticeable declines in the months that followed. This suggests that while the strategy delivered high performance early on, recent content may be losing momentum.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>To improve the performance and reverse the recent decline in engagement, focus more on video content especially those that share real stories or clearly explain product value. Refreshing the content style for the rest of the year is important, as engagement started to decline in May. It's also helpful to test successful formats, such as short videos or infographics, on platforms that have lower performance like Facebook and LinkedIn. High-performing hashtags should be used more consistently, while new ones can be tested to align with current trends. Revisiting the posting schedule and repeating the strategies that worked well in the early part of the year can help bring engagement back up.</p>
