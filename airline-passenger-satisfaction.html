                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: To identify who is flying, where they sit, how nine key service areas perform, which areas delight or disappoint, and how these factors combine to shape overall satisfaction and future retention.</p>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: The dataset contains 129,880 individual flight-experience records collected from a passenger satisfaction survey. Each row represents one completed trip and pairs operational data (delays, distance, cabin class) with attributes (gender, generation, travel purpose, customer type) and detailed service-quality evaluations across 14 touchpoints such as seat comfort, baggage handling, Wi-Fi, and online booking. All service items are scored on a 0 to 5.</p>

                <h4>Analysis Breakdown</h4>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/2 - apsr.png">
                <p>The data reveals out of 129,880 trips, roughly 65,900 were flown by women and 63,900 by men, creating a <strong>near-even gender split</strong> of 51% female vs. 49% male.</p>
                <div class="apsr-row-1">
                    <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/3a - apsr.png">
                    <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/3b - apsr.png">
                    <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/3c - apsr.png">
                </div>
                <p>The cabin breakdown shows 62,160 First Class trips, 58,309 Economy bookings, and only 9,411 Economy Plus seats. Passengers <strong>lean heavily</strong> toward the two ends of the price-comfort spectrum choosing either <em>full luxury</em> in First Class or the <em>essentials</em> in standard Economy, while fewer than 10% pick the mid-tier Economy Plus upgrade for extra legroom and priority seating.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/4 - apsr.png">
                <p>It reveals most trips come from <strong>loyal passengers</strong> in which about <strong>82%</strong> of records belong to returning customers, leaving only 18% from first-time passengers. This heavy tilt toward repeat business signals reflects the experiences and expectations of travelers already familiar with the airline.</p>
                <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/5 - apsr.png">
                <p><strong>Business</strong> and <strong>Economy</strong> cabins <strong>dominate</strong> with roughly 62k trips in Business and 58k in standard Economy, leaving just over 9k in Economy Plus. This means nearly half of all journeys were flown up front, another 45% in basic Economy, and only about 7% in the mid-tier option.</p>
                <div class="apsr-span-1">
                    <img src="../web-portfolio/images/apsr/6 - apsr.png"> 
                </div>
                <p>On average, the satisfaction score is <strong>3.2</strong> out of 5, indicating that the experience is <strong>barely satisfactory</strong>. Passengers are most satisfied with physical services, baggage handling (3.63), seat comfort (3.44), and staff service (3.38). But digital services and timing fall behind. Online booking (2.76) and in-flight Wi-Fi (2.73) score the lowest, while time convenience (3.06) is just slightly better than neutral. Overall, ground services do well, but digital tools and scheduling need work.</p>
                <h4>Key Insights</h4>
                <p>The dataset includes 129,880 passenger trips, which gives plenty of data to work with. The gender split is nearly equal (51% female, 49% male), so results represent both groups well. Most passengers (82%) are repeat customers, showing loyalty but also raising expectations. Seat choices are mostly at the high and low ends around 62,000 in Business/First Class and 58,000 in Economy. Only 9,000 chose Economy Plus, meaning it's not a popular middle option.</p>
                <p>The average satisfaction score is 3.2 out of 5. Passengers are most satisfied with basic services like baggage handling (3.63), seat comfort (3.44), and staff service (3.38). However, digital services and timing fall short in online booking (2.76), Wi-Fi (2.73), and time convenience (3.06) which are the biggest issues.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Airlines do well with personal service and cabin comfort, but fall short when it comes to digital tools and keeping schedules on track. Making it easier to book and improving in-flight Wi-Fi could quickly raise satisfaction above the current average of 3.2, especially important for the many loyal, repeat travelers who make up most of the passengers.</p>
